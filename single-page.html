        <h3>Tips and how to travel to Saudi Arabia in 2023</h3>
        <h5>Dec 7, 2022</h5>

        <p class="blog-para">
          Once one of the most difficult countries to visit, Saudi Arabia is
          finally issuing visas for tourism purposes and independent travel.
          <br /><br />

          Before, the only way to travel to Saudi was on a business visa, via a
          strong local connection who could sponsor your visit, or by getting a
          pilgrimage visa to visit Mecca and Medina (only for Muslims).<br /><br />

          Therefore, the fact that all of a sudden, Western tourists can visit
          Saudi Arabia on their own, with a backpack, both men and women, is a
          very radical change.<br /><br />

          This incredibly big change, however, didn’t come alone. <br /><br />

          During the last couple of years, a lot of their super strict Islamic
          laws have been softened or, at least, they have become more flexible.
          For example, allowing women and men to hang out together in public
          spaces was one of the most significant changes.<br /><br />

          All these small changes will make things easier for future
          international visitors.<br /><br />

          Despite everything that you may have read in the media, Saudi Arabia
          is an incredible country. There is just so much to do and see, a
          country filled with loads of stunning sites, both natural and
          archaeological, hugely contrasting landscapes and some extremely
          hospitable people that could easily rival my beloved friends from
          Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran.<br /><br />

          I strongly believe that this is the most underrated country on this
          planet, and here I have compiled a comprehensive travel guide to Saudi
          Arabia packed with tips and everything you need to know to travel to
          the Kingdom.<br /><br />

          How to get a visa on arrival (VOA) for Saudi Arabia In 2023, they also
          introduced a VOA regime, valid for any entry port into Saudi
          Arabia.<br /><br />

          The VOA on arrival costs 300 Saudi Rials, but they also make you buy
          travel insurance, which costs an additional 180 Saudi Rials.<br /><br />

          The total cost is 480 SR, cheaper than the e-visa.<br /><br />

          As of today, nobody understands why should someone go through the
          hassle of applying for an e-visa, when the VOA costs 55 SR less.<br /><br />

          <b>Can single women apply for a Saudi visa?</b> <br /><br />
          Yes, they certainly can, no restrictions for being a female.
          <br /><br />

          <b
            >What about the rest of the nationalities, can they travel to
            Saudi?</b
          >
          <br /><br />
          Actually, yes, they can.<br /><br />

          A fellow traveler with an Argentinian passport told me that she
          applied at the embassy in Buenos Aires and managed to get her visa in
          only 1 week.<br /><br />

          She had to present things like a payslip, vaccines, return flight
          ticket, and things like that.<br /><br />

          Also, travelers with valid US and Schengen visas – and that includes
          Indian and Pakistani citizens – can also get a visa for Saudi on
          arrival.<br /><br />

        <h3>Things to do in Iraq in a 10-day itinerary</h3>
        <h5>January 7, 2022</h5>

        <p class="blog-para">
            Despite being the cradle of civilization, home to ancient, historical places like Ur and Babylon, Iraq has always been the Middle East’s most well-kept secret.<br /><br />

            Back during Saddam’s time, unless you were a soldier or on a diplomatic mission, chances that you went to Iraq were pretty scarce.<br /><br />
            
            Then, came the American invasion, unleashing a nearly 20-year conflict that evolved into civil war between several parties, the Islamic State attracting most of the media attention.<br /><br />
            
            Today, the country has finally gained a certain stability and, with the introduction of a visa on arrival regime, intrepid travelers can finally discover the unknown – and absolutely epic – treasures Iraq has been hiding.<br /><br />
            
            This is a compelling 10-day itinerary containing the things to do in Iraq, and the itinerary we always follow during our expeditions.<br /><br />
            
            Remember that this post refers to Federal Iraq, not Kurdistan.<br /><br />
            
            For places to visit in Kurdistan, refer to our Iraq Kurdistan itinerary.
